            <li><strong>Prep Chicken:</strong> We will cook the chicken in some water. Once boiled
                 add a piece of onion and a pinch of salt to the chicken.
                It should cook for about 45 min.</li>
            <li><strong>Shred Chicken:</strong> Take the chicken out once cool to the hands. We will then
                 shred the chicken then add a little more salt and a little
                  pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Add to Heated Tortillas: </strong>Heat the tortillas up then add the chicken to them. Roll them
                 up and stick half a toothpick through them so they dont open.</li>
            <li><strong>Time to Fry: </strong>Add oil to a pan and put your flautas in the oil and make them
                 as crispy as you want</li>
